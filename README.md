## Notes on Template

### Ingredients
* There may be more than one ingredient table. Each table represents a complete process. For example, some bread recipes have a starter.
* Within a table, ingredients are listed in order of use in recipe.
* Ingredients that are seperated by a blank line indicate that the ingredients may be used together or seperately as per the instructions. Example, baked goods that have you seperately combine wet and dry ingredients, or ganishes that are not meant to be included in the cooking process.
