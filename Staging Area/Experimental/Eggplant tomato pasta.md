## Additional Notes

### Experimental Notes
* Ingredients used 1 medium eggplant, could have used half the eggplant. The eggplant was burning and couldn't be cooked quite enough. Less eggplant, or cooking in batches may have helped.
* 1/4 large onion, 2 tomatoes, red and green pepper, garlic, red pepper flakes, ground sweet italian chicken sausage, mozzarrella sticks cut into semi-cubes.
* Could have added, white wine, or served on side
* Salt from onion and peper was added to tomato instead. Was allowed to stand for several inutes with the diced tomato.
* Used a large dutch oven. Covered all ingredients while cooking except eggplant
* Added no liquid. Result ended up with enough liquid from the ingredients.
* Onion and pepper were added together with dallop of pre-minced garlic. After about 2 minuts, chicken was added and peper flakes were thrown in at some point near the end. Stired several times to ensure even cooking, then eggplant added back in to finish out the cooking. Covered and let simmer for several minutes. Trunned heat off and added cheese. Served about 1 minute later.
