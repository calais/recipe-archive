## Ingredients  
| # | Unit | Name  | Prep Notes |
|---| ---- | ----  | ---------- |
| 6 | Tbsp | flour |  |
| 1/2 | tsp | salt |  |
| 1/2 | tsp | pepper |  |
| 1/4 | tsp | paprika |  |
| 1 | t | garlic powder | or 2 Tbsp minced garlic |
|  |  |  |  |
| 6 | oz | bacon |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| 4 | Tbsp | bacon grease |  |
| 2 | Tbsp | butter |  |
|  |  |  |  |
| 3 | c | milk |  |

## Instructions
1. Combine flour and spices in dish. You want a 1 to 1 ratio of flour to fat.
2. Cook bacon until just starting to brown. Be careful not to overcook or gravy will taste like burnt bacon. Remove bacon from pan and allow to cool before chopping.
3. Pour grease into heat safe dish and measure out 4 tablespoons to be returned to the pan. More grease could be substituted for butter to intensify bacon flavor.
4. Turn heat to medium, add butter and allow to melt. Add flour, mix well and allow to cook until puffy, about 5-7 minutes. You’re making a roux with this step. The longer it cooks the more flavor and color it adds. Longer cook time reduces thickening power if you like a thinner gravy.
5. Add 1 cup of milk and mix well. It should thicken up FAST. Add the rest of the milk and cook until desired thickness. Taste and add additional salt and pepper if desired. Your bacon may make this more or less salty, so do taste it first.

## Additional Notes

### Substitutions and Modifications
The heart of this recipe is in the ratio between liquid, flour, and fat. 1 cup milk to two tablespoons flour and two tablespoons fat. Everything else can be adjusted to suit your own taste. 1 to 1 ½ cups of milk per person is the best way to adjust this recipe to the necessary number of servings.
