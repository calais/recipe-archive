## Vital Notes 
* For super smooth hummus make chickpeas from scratch and overcook.
* Warm chickpeas make smoother hummus than cold chickpeas.
* If using canned chickpeas, you may want to remove the skins for smoother hummus.
* Raw garlic overpowers in this recipe. Consider using refrigerated minced garlic or cooking the garlic before adding.
* Olive oil turns bitter with blending, so mix it in by hand.

## Instructions

### Chickpeas from scratch
1. Soak chickpeas overnight. They will triple in size so make sure to have plenty of room and water for expansion
2. Drain chickpeas. In dutch oven, cover with a couple of inches of water and add preferred spices, excluding salt. Bring to boil and reduce to simmer.  
    1. Allow to cook, covered, checking water level periodically. Add water to keep chickpeas submerged as needed.
    2. Start checking chickpeas at one hour mark. When they are starting to get tender, add salt.
    3. Overcooked chickpeas are best for hummus, so when they seem perfectly creamy and tender let them cook a while longer. How long depends on preference.
    4. If using immediately, strain chickpeas, reserve cooking juices for thinning hummus, and allow to cool until they can be comfortably handled. Remove bay leaf if used.

### The hummus
3. If using canned chickpeas, or if chickpeas were stored in the fridge, warm them up for smoother blending.
4. Add grouped ingredients to food processor and blend well. Use cooking juice, water, or broth to thin hummus to desired consistency.
5. Transfer to bowl and stir in olive oil.
6. Adjust salt and lemon juice to taste, this can also be done after refrigeration. The olive oil flavor will diminish with time while the garlic will come forward more.
7. Refrigerate to cool and allow flavors to meld.
