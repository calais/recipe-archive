## Instructions
1. Line pan with parchment paper.
2. Combine butter, sugar, cocoa, and salt in double boiler. Stir occasionally as butter until butter is melted and mixture is smooth. Mixture should be cool enough that you can dip a finger in but hot enough that you want to remove it quickly. Set mixture aside until warm but not hot.
3. Preheat oven.
4. Stir in vanilla. Add eggs one at a time, stirring vigorously. When batter looks thick and shiny add flour and mix well. Stir in nuts if using.
5. Bake until toothpick test shows up clean. Brownies should rise and look puffy.
6. Let cool completely on rack or in fridge before cutting.
