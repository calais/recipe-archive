# Toll House Cookies

Original Source: Back of the NEstle Chocolate Chip bag  
Servings: 5 dozen cookies  
Total time:   
Cook time:   
Oven temp: 375Â°  

## Vital Notes 
* To reduce sugar content: Sugar can safely be cut by 1/3, so a full recipe would use 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. The actual chocolate chips can also be reduced to reduce sugar.
* When making so many cookies, remember to freeze some! Even a half batch makes too many unless sharing.
* Experimentation required to reduce sugar to a minimum. Haven't tried apple sauce yet, but should in future. Applesauce should be substituted 1:1. Probably try replacing just the white sugar.
