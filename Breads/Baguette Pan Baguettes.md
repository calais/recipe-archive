## Instructions

### Starter
1. Combine ingredients and mix until well blended.
2. Let rise, covered, at room temp for 12 - 24 hours.

* When ready, starter should dome slightly on the top and look aerated and bubbly. Try to use before it falls for optimum flavor and vigor.

### Dough
1. Combine starter and dough ingredients using prefered mixing method (mixer, bread machine, or by hand).
2. (Skip if using bread machine) Transfer dough to lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise for 2 hours. Fold after 1st hour to strengthen gluten, or more often if dough is very slack/wet.
3. Divide dough into three pieces and pre-form into rough logs. 
4. Let rest 20 minutes then shape into baguettes. 
5. Proof baguettes, covered, on pan until puffy, about 30 - 40 minutes.
6. Preheat oven to 500°. 
7. Just prior to putting in oven, slash tops of loaves several time at 45° angle, 1/2 in deep. 
8. Spritz loaves with water, place in oven and reduce temperature to 475°. 
9. Bake 18 - 24 minutes. Remove when they are a deep, golden brown, and transfer to rack to cool.

## Additional Notes

* For an extra crispy crust, spray inside of oven with water twice during first 5 minutes.
